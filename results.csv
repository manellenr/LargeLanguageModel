The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a new system for measuring the electrical power of a network of power plants. The system uses a computer model to measure the power output of each plant. It is based on the assumption that the plant is operating at a constant power level. This is the same assumption as the one used in the NIST system. In the",0.7078651685393258,2.999610662460327,474.7001953125

Robots will help us with tasks that are difficult for humans to do, such as cleaning up after a spill or helping us move furniture. Humans will also be involved in tasks where robots are not needed, like helping with the cleaning of a home or office.

The robots will have different capabilities, and will need to be programmed to perform specific tasks. For example, a robot that can clean up",0.6853932584269663,18.094202280044556,5018.5234375
