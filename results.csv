The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a new system for measuring the electrical power of a network of power plants. The system uses a computer model to measure the power output of each plant. It is based on the assumption that the plant is operating at a constant power level. This is the same assumption as the one used in the NIST system. In the",0.7078651685393258,1.008958339691162,2.32839035987854,474.7001953125
